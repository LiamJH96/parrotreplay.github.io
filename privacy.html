Privacy Policy for Parrot Replay

Version 1.0 – Effective Date: 17 November 2025
Developer: Parrot Replay Software

1. Introduction

Parrot Replay operates entirely offline and is built with privacy in mind.
It does not automatically transmit personal information to the Developer or any third party.
Some limited system information is processed locally to generate and verify licence activation.

By using the Software, you agree to this Privacy Policy.


2. Data Collection and Processing

The Software performs no telemetry, analytics, or background data collection.

When you request a licence, a local licence-request file is generated containing:

A one-way SHA-256-hashed hardware identifier (Hardware ID),

Your computer name,

Your operating-system name, and

The date and time of generation.

This information is shown on-screen and is only shared manually if you choose to send it to the Developer.

If you send your licence request through Discord or another platform, that communication is subject to the respective platform’s privacy policy.
The Developer may retain the message (including the hashed hardware ID), your email, your Discord username (if provided), and any Hardware ID you provide solely for verification, anti-abuse, and reissue purposes.
It is never exported, resold, or used outside Discord, and may be deleted upon request.

Once a licence is issued, the Developer does not otherwise store or reuse request data.


3. Audio Recordings

All recordings remain stored locally on your device.
You control creation, deletion, and sharing.
The Developer has no access to your recordings and bears no responsibility for their content or distribution.


4. Third-Party Software

Parrot Replay interfaces with third-party audio-routing utilities from VB-Audio Software, including:

VB-Audio Virtual Cable (Free)

VB-Audio CABLE C+D Pack (Donationware – minimum donation required on the official site)

Users may choose between:

Official VB-Audio Download (Minimum Donation Required) – strongly recommended to support the VB-Audio developer, or

Community Archive (Free) – a community-maintained mirror on Archive.org.

Parrot Replay does not host or control these downloads and is not responsible for their privacy practices.


5. Payments and Third-Party Processing (Stripe)

If you purchase a licence through the official Parrot Replay website, payments are processed securely by Stripe.
When purchasing, Stripe may collect information such as your email address, payment method details, billing country, and transaction identifiers.

Parrot Replay Software does not receive or store your full payment details.
Only the following may be visible to the Developer through Stripe’s dashboard:

• Your email address  
• Your Discord username (if you provide it in the checkout form)  
• Your Hardware ID  
• Basic order metadata needed to deliver your licence

Stripe’s handling of your payment information is governed by Stripe’s own Privacy Policy and terms.

No payment information is stored by Parrot Replay Software outside Stripe.


6. Data Security

No user or hardware data ever leaves your computer automatically.
Licence files and recordings are stored locally.

If a future version includes an optional update-check, it will contact only an official Parrot Replay distribution page (such as a verified website or repository) to compare version numbers.
No personal or system data will be transmitted.


7. Children’s Privacy

The Software is not intended for children under 13 and intentionally collects no data from them.


8. Policy Updates

This Privacy Policy may be updated periodically.
The latest version will always ship with the Software.
Continued use after updates constitutes acceptance of the revised terms.


9. Summary

Licence requests use local-only hashed system data.

No telemetry or background collection.

No automatic transmission or cloud storage.

Recordings remain entirely under user control.

Developer retains licence request data only if voluntarily provided through Stripe checkout or Discord.
